                    <h1>About Us</h1>
					<hr>					
                    <p><strong>Hi I'm Johanna.</strong></p>                                 
                    <p>Being a professional Holistic therapist and Aromatherapist and being interested in natural beauty and cosmetics I realised I could develop my own skin care line as for many years I had been formulating and developing with my mother natural skin care recipes as a hobby, as we both have an interest in natural skin care. From then on I have been hooked, and it has always been a passion. Developing my own skin care line just made sense and seemed to be a natural progression for my business.
So, hence Not So Balmy was born.

                    <p> A small west Yorkshire based cottage industry family run business founded by myself and my mother Kim. We pride ourselves in formulating our own recipes from scratch in our workshop – not outsourced to a factory. This is quite unusual in skin care manufacturing and it ensures you the highest level of product quality and freshness. Everything is made by hand in small batches, from weighing the ingredients to blending the product, filling the jars and labelling - and contain nothing but natural ingredients - oil, butter, essential oil, extract or wax - ingredients that has been derived from a plant.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="natural.html">read - what does natural mean in the world of cosmetics?</a>. Skin and body care products are naturally scented with artisan quality essential oils, to create different blends that are unique to Not So Balmy.</p>

                    <p>We are proud that our handmade Not So Balmy skin care range fully comply with all legislation governing the manufacture of cosmetics in the UK and Europe, through the process of being fully laboratory tested and certified. We formulate and make our own skin creams from scratch in small batches using the right amount of science. Our products contain the highest possible quality of naturally derived ingredients and we do our best to include as many certified organic ingredients in our products as possible, because we know thats what you like. We formulate our products to include natural and organic components so they are paraben (due to peoples fear about parabens) and peg free with no toxic chemicals or preservatives, only eco friendly preservatives that are gentle and mild and suitable for all skin types <a href="cosmetic-preservatives.html">read - why you need to preserve natural skin cosmetics</a>. We also, make sure all raw materials we use to manufacture our products are not tested on animals and are cruelty free, of course! And we would never sell any skin product to customers that we have not tested on our own skin first.</p>

			<h3>Cruelty Free</h3>

                    <img src="images/services-image-4.jpg" class="img-polaroid" style="margin:5px 0px 15px;" alt="">   </div>          
                <div class="span10">              
                   <p>Why did I decide to formulate a Vegan Skin care range that is Cruelty free and entirely free of animal products? The simple answer is - I am a vegan and a dedicated animal lover!</p><p> Cruelty-free is a catch-all term generally used for products that haven’t been tested on animals and the term Vegan is used for products that don’t contain any ingredients derived from animals? If you don’t know much about veganism, you may not realize that being a vegan not only relates to someone’s diet, but it can also relate to a person’s entire way of life in consciously choosing not to eat or use anything that is animal-derived.</p>
<p>You may also not realize that a lot of products contain animal products; even so called vegan brands can contain traces of animal products.  It can be easier to maintain a vegan diet; but when it comes to cosmetics it can be a little trickier. But, generally when you choose to eat or use something that is vegan you can be assured that the food or product in question did not involve an animal in any way. This includes the testing for the product. The good news is that today, a multitude of cruelty-free cosmetics and household products are not tested on animals. <p>You just have to do your best to avoid animal products in cosmetics to force cosmetic companies around the world to stop the unnecessary suffering and killing of animals for cosmetics testing. But don't get Barmy about it because it doesn't help. </p><p><strong>This is what the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) Foundation (A UK-based charity dedicated to establishing and protecting the rights of all animals) say on their website –</strong> “No one can avoid every single animal ingredient, being vegan is about helping animals not maintaining personal purity. Boycotting products that may contain trace amounts of animal products can actually be harmful to animals in the long run. For example, by refusing to eat a veggie burger from a restaurant because the bun may contain traces of milk or eggs, you are discouraging that restaurant from offering vegan options because it is seen as too difficult a task".</p><p><strong>PETA also says this –</strong>“People who have made the compassionate decision to stop eating animal flesh, eggs, and dairy products may wonder if they need to read every ingredient to check for tiny amounts of obscure animal products. Our general advice is not to worry too much about doing this. The goal of sticking to a vegetarian or vegan diet is to help animals and reduce suffering; this is done by choosing a bean burrito or a veggie burger over chicken flesh, or choosing tofu scramble over eggs, not by refusing to eat an otherwise vegan food because it has 0.001 grams of monoglycerides that may possibly be animal-derived.”</p><p><strong>PETA also says this -</strong> We discourage vegetarians from grilling waiters at restaurants about micro-ingredients in vegetarian foods (e.g., a tiny bit of a dairy product in the bun of a veggie burger). Doing so makes sticking to a vegetarian diet seem difficult and dogmatic to your friends and to restaurant staff, thus discouraging them from giving a vegetarian diet a try (which really hurts animals). And we urge vegetarians not to insist that their food be cooked on equipment separate from that used to cook meat; doing so doesn’t help any additional animals, and it only makes restaurants less inclined to offer vegetarian choices (which, again, hurts animals)."</p>

<p>So if you want to help animals – the answer is gentle persuasion. And don’t get BARMY about it, get NOT SO BALMY about it and use OUR SKIN CARE PRODUCTS WHICH ARE ENTIRELY FREE OF ANIMAL PRODUCTS.</P>

<h3>YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE WORLD OVERNIGHT, BUT YOU CAN HAVE A DARNED GOOD TRY!</h3><h4>Alternative scientific tests are often more reliable than animal tests. <br></h4><p>Changes around the world may not be happening fast enough for some people but today, scientists have developed and validated alternative methods shown to lead to safer and more effective products and drugs for humans than animal testing.  Alternative scientific tests are often more reliable than animal tests For example, experiments on rats, hamsters, guinea pigs, mice, monkeys, and baboons revealed no link between glass fibers and cancer. Only after human studies related the two did the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) label these fibers as carcinogenic. EpiDerm, an in vitro test derived from cultured human skin cells, was found to be more accurate in identifying chemical skin irritants than traditional animal tests. In comparison studies, EpiDerm correctly detected all of the test chemicals that irritate human skin, while tests on rabbits misclassified 10 out of 25 test chemicals—a full 40% error rate.</p><br><h4>Some alternatives to the use of animals in testing include</h4>
<ul><li>in vitro (test tube) test methods and models based on human cell and tissue cultures</li>
<li>computerized patient-drug databases and virtual drug trials</li>
<li>computer models and simulations</li>
<li>stem cell and genetic testing methods</li>
<li>non-invasive imaging techniques such as MRIs and CT Scans</li>
<li>microdosing (in which humans are given very low quantities of a drug to test the effects on the body on the cellular level, without affecting the whole body system)</li></ul><br>
<h4>Some more benefits of non-animal testing</h4>
<ul><li>The use of human tissue in toxicity testing is more accurate than the animal models. </li><li>Non-animal tests are more cost-effective, practical, and expedient.</li><li> Cruelty-free products are more environmentally friendly.</li>
<br><p>Science is moving toward the day when cruelty-free research and testing will be the status quo. Science can and must protect animals’ lives, the environment, and promote better health and well-being for humans. Public demand for more humane Science, thanks to modern technologies, is finally moving forward to realize the premise that the “best test species for humans are humans”—without harm and with enormous benefit to humans.....<a href="safety-vs-natural.html">read more</a></p>
