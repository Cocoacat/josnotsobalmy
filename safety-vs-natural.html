                 <h3>What are the good arguments for not testing on animals?</h3>
                 <p><strong>Animal tests have scientific limitations</strong>, as different species respond differently when exposed to the same chemicals. Consequently, results from animal tests may not be relevant to humans, as they can under- or overestimate real-world hazards to people.</p>
				 <p> In addition, results from animal tests can be quite variable and difficult to interpret. Unreliable and ineffective animal tests mean consumer safety cannot be guaranteed.</p>

        <h3>Keep Calm and say No to Animal Testing!</h3>        
          <img src="images/sunset.jpg" class="img-polaroid" alt="">
		  
			<h3>Alternatives!</h3>
                 <p><strong>As hard as it is to believe, animal experiments for cosmetics and household products continue even though non-animal tests are widely available.</strong> In contrast, non-animal alternatives can combine human cell-based tests and sophisticated computer models to deliver human-relevant results in hours or days, unlike some animal tests that can take months or years. Non-animal alternatives are also typically much more cost-effective than tests that use animals. Instead of measuring how long it takes a chemical to burn the cornea of a rabbit’s eye, manufacturers can now drop that chemical onto cornea-like 3D tissue structures produced from human cells. Likewise, human skin cultures can be grown and purchased for skin irritation testing. <strong>Non-animal tests currently in use are faster and more accurate at predicting human reactions to a product than animal tests ever were.</strong></p>
				<h3>So, why when the European Union (EU) law was fully implemented that made it illegal to sell animal-tested cosmetics in Europe – Is it still going on?</h3> <p><strong> Although companies can’t sell animal-tested cosmetics in Europe, they can continue to test cosmetics on animals outside Europe and sell them in other markets.</strong> Therefore, companies can still profit from cruelty to animals – just not in Europe. This is particularly important because many large emerging markets, such as China, are demanding that cosmetics be tested on animals. Because of this, the only way to be completely sure that you aren’t indirectly supporting animal testing is to continue to purchase products only from companies that don’t test on animals.</p>

                    <h1>Safety vs Natural</h1>
					<hr>	
                   <p><strong>I agree that whenever possible, use ingredients that are organic or natural...when that means they are both safe and effective. Safe and effective are key! Natural isn't always safe. </strong> Bacterial contamination is natural and not a chemical but you don't want that on your face!  Trust me, I know all too well about skin care bacterial contamination from my many years experience of making skincare products.  Poison ivy is natural, but I wouldn't rub it on my face. . As well as being toxic to humans plant-derived ingredients can cause skin irritation in exactly the same way as man-made products. Just because an ingredient comes from a plant DOES NOT make it safe – thousands and thousands of plants are poisonous, such that animals in the wild know which plants and berries to avoid. The most famous historic plant poison is Deadly Nightshade or Belladonna from the Atropa Belladonna plant which women would drop into their eyes to dilate the pupils and give a more attractive appearance but it caused increased heart rate and eventually blindness. </p>
                    <p>The thing that makes scientists rage is the notion that ‘natural’ or “organic” ingredients are safer and better for you than man-made ingredients – This is the notion of a sector of the women’s health, beauty, and cosmetics industries that are super-vigilant and concerned about the safety of ingredients. Natural and organic product companies and retailers are now generating billions each year off of fear mongering and perpetuating myths, pushing this notion to sell products through  this scare – mongering. Even if a company does have "organic" labeling,  "An ingredient's source does not determine its safety.  Organic certification only tells you the source of an ingredient—not whether it’s safe for skin or what benefits it may or may not have. Many plants, whether or not they are organically grown, contain substances that may be toxic or allergenic.</p>
                   <p>So, when it comes to beauty products, natural or organic ingredients aren’t necessarily any better, safer or healthier for skin.  "There are lots of great natural ingredients just as there are lots of great synthetic ingredients – the best products utilise both to the consumer's advantage!" Substantiated, published research has yet to prove that organic ingredients used in cosmetics are superior to or safer than non-organic or synthetic ingredients. The bottom line: There are good and bad ingredients in each category. So, rather than thinking in terms of organic vs. non-organic, natural vs. Synthetic, natural vs. unnatural when it comes to skin care, just remember  there are good and bad natural and synthetic ingredients,</p>
